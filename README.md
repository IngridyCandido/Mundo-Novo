- Live Site URL: (https://ingridycandido.github.io/Mundo-Novo/) 

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive viewer

### What I learned

I learned how to put a page inside another, as well as how to work with video, audio, images and forms.

Something I'd like to highlight is this part of the menu that links the pages together:

```html
        <ul class="menu">
            <li><a href="index.html">In&iacute;cio</a></li>
            <li><a href="video.html">V&iacute;deo</a></li>
            <li><a href="audio.html">&Aacute;udio</a></li>
            <li><a href="contato.html">Contato</a></li>
        </ul>
```

And this tool stops when the mouse hovers over an element:

```css
#github:hover, #linkedin:hover {
    color: rgb(192, 141, 107);
}
```
When I started programming again, I'd forgotten how to do a lot of things. Developing this site has allowed me to relearn and have some fun. It's also a source of relief and hope. I hope to return in the future and be proud of having dedicated my time to studying.

### Continued development

I want to learn more about frontend and embedded systems.
